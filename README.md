# Optimizing Used Car Price Prediction: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms

The challenge of predicting used car prices holds significant importance, especially in regions where leasing is prevalent. However, it's not an easy task due to the multitude of factors affecting a car's value, such as its age, mileage, make, and more specific details like fuel type and safety features. With only limited data available, it's crucial to focus on the most impactful factors to ensure accurate predictions.

In this study, we aim to create a reliable prediction model for used car prices by utilizing linear regression, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. By comparing the performance of these algorithms, we'll identify the most effective one for our dataset. This process will help us determine which features have the most influence on price prediction and refine our model accordingly.

Through our analysis and comparison of these algorithms, we seek to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry. By improving the accuracy of used car price predictions, we aim to assist dealerships and consumers alike in making informed decisions, ultimately contributing to a more efficient and transparent automotive market.
